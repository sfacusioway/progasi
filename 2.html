            After the usual pit bike 17/14, the SMART 150 MAX rides much softer, the wheels 19/16 and the suspension perfectly work out the irregularities. Among the advantages are also light, tidy, good brakes with reinforced hoses. In general, the bike is quite balanced, it is not suitable for racing, but it allows you to ride along forest paths with pleasure.

            This bike is just a bomb! It is convenient for me both in weight and strength. There is no surplus for me. We bought it in the store, already assembled, asked to naturally run the bike, oil change, etc. It was a gift from Dad, and I was overwhelmed with emotions. I've been riding for a long time, riding almost every day. And I put it in two words - I am satisfied!

            A great bike for enduro rides. It is convenient that there are passenger footrests and you can ride together. The seat is comfortable and long, by the way, it does not get wet, unlike the same Cayo or BSE. The light is super bright, there are already 5 headlight diodes in the new generation, it turned out to be super bright. The motor is traction, the frame is welded with high quality. The presence of the device is a separate story. Speed, odometer, battery charge, gear indicator. Before buying, I also read reviews about the program. Everyone writes the technique is very decent, which I actually agree with.
